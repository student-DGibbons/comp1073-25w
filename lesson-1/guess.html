		<h1>Number Guessing Game</h1>
		<p>I have picked a random number between 1 and 100. You have 10 chances to guess the number.</p>

		<!-- Guessing form controls -->
		<label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label>
		<input type="number" id="guessField">
		<button>Submit guess</button>

		<!-- Elements to contain feedback for user -->
		<section>
			<p id="guesses"></p>
			<p id="lastResult"></p>
			<p id="lowOrHi"></p>
		</section>

		<script>
			// STEP 1: Initialize game variables
			// STEP 1a: Pick random number

			let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
			
			// STEP 1b: Create variables to represent the three paragraphs above that will contain user feedback
			
			const guesses = document.querySelector("#guesses");
			const lastResult = document.querySelector("#lastResult");
			const lowOrHi = document.querySelector("#lowOrHi");


			// STEP 1c: Create variables to represent the guessing form
			const guessField = document.querySelector("#guessField");
			const guessSubmit = document.querySelector("button");

			// STEP 1d: Create variables to initialize counter for number of guesses
			let guessCount = 1;

			// STEP 2: Put focus on the field that allows user to type in guesses
			guessField.focus();


			// STEP 3: Build a function to check the user's guess
			function checkGuess() {
			
				// STEP 3b: Create a variable to contain what number the user entered
				console.log("User guessed!");
				// STEP 3c: If this is the first guess, add some text to the screen as a label for listing previous guesses for reference
				
				
				
				// STEP 3d: Add the user's current guess to that list, plus a space
				
				
				// STEP 3e: Conditional - the user guessed correctly
				
					// Output a success message, then end the game
					
					
					
					
				// STEP 3f: Conditional - the user is all out of guesses
				
					// Output an appropriate message, then end the game
					
					
				// STEP 3g: Conditional - the user's guess is incorrect
				
					// Output an appropriate message
					
					
					// If the guess is too low, let the user know
					
					
					// Else if the guess is too high, let the user know
					
					
				
				// STEP 3h: Increment the guess count, move focus to the guess field for the next guess, and clear out the old input
				
			}	
			// STEP 4: Build a function called gameOver() to end the game
			
				// STEP 4a: Disable the guessing field and submit button
				
				
				// STEP 4b: Change the textContent of the #lowOrHi paragraph to a short phrase indicating that the game is over, and that the user can start a new game by refreshing the browser page or tab
				
			
			// STEP 3a: Add an event listener for the guess form button that calls the checkGuess function, then test that the event listener is working and that it invokes the function
			guessSubmit.addEventListener("click", checkGuess);
